Revision history for DBM::Deep.

0.99_03 Jan ?? 00:00:00 2007 EDT
    - THIS VERSION IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH FILES FROM ALL OTHER PRIOR VERSIONS.
      - The fileformat changed completely. I will be writing a converter, but
        it's not there right now. Do NOT expect that this module will
        correctly detect older versions and handle them sanely. Sanity will be
        there for 1.00, but we're not there yet, are we?
    - Converted to use FileHandle::Fmode to handle filehandle status checks
    - Fixed bug with deleting already-deleted items on Win32 (reported by Nigel Sandever)
    - The guts of how transactions work has been rewritten to better handle
      some edgecases. This required a complete rewrite of the engine.
    - Freespace management is now in place. It's not perfect, but it's there.
    - The rewrite of the engine required a rewrite of how first_key/next_key
      was implemented. This should result in significant speed improvements.
    - Self-reference has been removed. This means you cannot do:
          $db->{foo} = { x => 'y' };
          $db->{bar} = $db->{foo};
      I hope to be able to return this functionality by 1.00, but I cannot
      promise anything. To do this properly, it requires refcounting in order
      to correctly handle deletions and transactions. Once you move away from
      a simple tree, everything becomes really hard.

0.99_02 Apr 28 05:00:00 2006 Pacific
    - Added missing file to the MANIFEST

0.99_01 Apr 27 18:00:00 2006 Pacific
    - Added explicit dependency on Perl 5.6.0
      - Digest::MD5 requires 5.6.0
      - Sub::Uplevel (dep of Test::Exception) requires 5.6.0
    - Removed error()/clear_error()
      - All error-handling is done with die()
    - Broke out DBM::Deep's code into DBM::Deep::Engine
    - Tied variables can no longer be assigned to a DBM::Deep object.
      - This includes cross-file assignments.
    - Autovivification now works
      - This is a consequence of the fact that all assignments are tied.
    - set_pack() and set_digest() have been removed.
      - Instead, you will now pass the appropriate values into new()
      - A pack_size parameter has been added to make 64-bit files easier
    - Transactions now work

0.983 Apr 10 20:00:00 2006 Pacific
    - Added patch inspired by Jeff Janes (Thanks!)
      - Autovivification now works correctly
      - The following now works correctly
        my %hash = ( a => 1 );
        $db->{hash} = \%hash;
        $hash{b} = 2;
        cmp_ok( $db->{hash}{b}, '==', 2 );
    - (RT#18530) - DBM::Deep now plays nicely with -l

0.982 Mar 08 11:00:00 2006 Pacific
    - Fixed smoketests that were failing on Win32
    - Added restriction for Perl 5.6.0 or higher.
      - Digest::MD5 and Sub::Uplevel (dep of Test::Exception) require 5.6+

0.981 Mar 06 11:00:00 2006 Pacific
    - (RT#17947) - Fixed test that was failing on older Perls

0.98  Feb 28 11:00:00 2006 Pacific
    - Added in patch by David Cantrell to allow use of DATA filehandle
    - Fixed bug where attempting to export() a structure that used autobless would die
    - Fixed arraytest slowness by localizing $SIG{__DIE__} to prevent Test::Builder's
      $SIG{__DIE__} from being called. (q.v. http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/eval.html)
    - More methods have been made private:
        - root() is now _root()
        - base_offset() is now _base_offset()
        - fh() is now _fh()
        - type() is now _type()
        - precalc_sizes() is now _precalc_sizes()

0.97  Feb 24 10:00:00 2006 Pacific
    - Reorganization of distribution to a more standard layout
    - Migration to Module::Build with EU::MM backwards compatibility
    - Migration of all tests to use Test::More and Test::Exception
    - Added Devel::Cover report to DBM::Deep POD
      - Test coverage improved to 89.6% (and climbing)
    - The following methods have been renamed to reflect their private nature:
        - init() is now _init()
        - open() is now _open()
        - close() is now _close()
        - load_tag() is now _load_tag()
        - index_lookup() is now _index_lookup()
        - add_bucket() is now _add_bucket()
        - get_bucket_value() is now _get_bucket_value()
        - delete_bucket() is now _delete_bucket()
        - bucket_exists() is now _bucket_exists()
        - find_bucket_list() is now _find_bucket_list()
        - traverse_index() is now _traverse_index()
        - get_next_key() is now _get_next_key()
        - copy_node() is now _copy_node()
        - throw_error() is now _throw_error()
    - The various tied classes have been broken out. This means that testing
        "ref( $obj ) eq 'DBM::Deep'" will now fail. The correct test is
        "eval { $obj->isa( 'DBM::Deep' ) }".
    - The various methods like push and delete now have the same return values as
      the standard builtins.
    - TIEARRAY and TIEHASH now check their parameters more thoroughly
    - Negative indices for arrays works as expected, including throwing the appropriate
      errors.
    - RT #16877 is fixed (DBM::Deep broken with Perl 5.9.3+).
    - RT #14893 is fixed (tie() and new() use different parameter lists).
    - A bug with optimize and threading is fixed.
    - autobless has received some attention, resulting in a number of bugs fixed.
    - Removed mode option as it just caused confusion.
    - Removed volatile option as it is pretty useless (use locking instead)
    - Locking now implicitly enables autoflush

0.96  Oct 14 09:55:00 2005 Pacific
    - Fixed build (OS X hidden files killed it)
    - You can now pass in an optional filehandle to the constructor

0.95  Oct 12 13:58:00 2005 Pacific
    - Added optional autobless flag to preserve and restore blessed hashes
    - Fixed bug where 0 could not be fetched using get_next_key
    - Fixed bug where tie() constructor didn't accept a hash ref for args
    - optimize() now preserves user/group/permissions
    - Errors are now FATAL (meaning it calls die()), unless you set debug flag

0.94  Apr 13 19:00:26 2004 Pacific
    - Fixed bug reported by John Cardenas (corruption at key level when
         replace of less data was done on bucket)

0.93  Feb 15 19:53:17 2004 Pacific
    - Fixed optmize() on Win32 where orig file couldn't be overwritten unless
         filehandle was closed first.  This change introduces a potential race
         condition when using locking and optmize() on Win32, but it can be 
         fixed in the future using a soft copy instead of Perl's rename().

0.92  Feb 12 19:10:22 2004 Pacific
    - Fixed bug where passing a reference to a different DBM::Deep object
         would still result in an internal reference.
    - Added export() method for recursively extracting hashes/arrays into
         standard in-memory Perl structures.
    - Added import() method for recursively importing existing Perl hash/
         array structures
    - Fixed bug where optimize() wouldn't work if base level of DB was
         an array instead of a hash.

0.91  Feb 12 02:30:22 2004 Pacific
    - Fixed bug with splice() when length of removed section was 0
    - Updated POD re: circular refs and optimize()
    - Had to jump version numbers to 0.91 because in previous releases
         I used only a single digit after the decimal which was confusing
         the CPAN indexer.

0.10  Feb 11 08:58:35 2004 Pacific
    - Fixed bug where default file mode was CLEARING files (Thanks Rich!)
    - Added experimental support for circular references
    - Fixed bugs in shift(), unshift() and splice() where nested objects
      	in array would be recursively re-stored as basic hashes/arrays
    - Fixed typos in POD docs

0.9   Feb 10 03:25:48 2004 Pacific
    - Added Filters for storing/fetching keys/values
    - Added hook for supplying own hashing algorithm
    - FIxed some typos in POD docs, added new sections

0.8   Feb 8 02:38:22 2004 Pacific
    - Renamed to DBM::Deep for CPAN
    - Added optimize() method for rekindling unused space
    - Now returning hybrid tie()/OO object from new()
    - Basic error handling introduced
    - Added debug mode for printing errors to STDERR
    - Added TYPE_HASH and TYPE_ARRAY constants for "type" param
    - Added clone() method for safe copying of objects
    - Wrote POD documentation
    - Added set_pack() function for manipulating LONG_SIZE / LONG_PACK
    - Added aliases for most tied functions for public use
    - Now setting binmode() on FileHandle for Win32
    - Added 45 unit tests

0.7   Jan 4 11:31:50 2003 UTC
    - Renamed to DeepDB
    - Changed file signature to DPDB (not compatible with older versions)
    - Converted array length to packed long instead of sprintf()ed string

0.6   Dec 31 15:12:03 2002 UTC
    - Some misc optimizations for speed

0.5   Oct 18 08:55:29 2002 UTC
    - support for force_return_next parameter in traverse_index() method for 
      ultra-fast combined key search/removal

0.4   Oct 15 20:07:47 2002 UTC
    - now making sure filehandle is open for all DB calls

0.3   Oct 3 19:04:13 2002 UTC
    - fixed bug that could cause corrupted data when using locking

0.2   Aug 6 16:37:32 2002 UTC
    - Removed base index caching, as it can cause problems when two processes 
      are populating the db at the same time (even with locking)

0.1   Jun 3 08:06:26 2002 UTC
    - initial release
